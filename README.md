# Radiation Model
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rice-solar-physics/Radiation_Model.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rice-solar-physics/Radiation_Model)

Radiation_Model can be used to calculate radiative losses in hydrodynamic codes using the ionization states (equilibrium or non-equilibrium) for any number of elements and ionization states. All configuration is done via an XML configuration file. See the [docs](http://rice-solar-physics.github.io/Radiation_Model/) for more information. The docs are currently under development, but stil may be useful to some.

## Dependencies
You will need the following in order to use Radiation_Model:

* `apolloDB`
* `rsp_toolkit`
